# Survival Game Project

## Basic Information
- **Project:** Survival Game
- **Language:** C++

## Project Description
This project is a survival game where the player navigates a procedurally generated world, searching for food and water while avoiding hazards. The world is represented by a polymorphic 2D array of pointers to a `Land` base class, which is extended by various terrain types such as forests, deserts, and lakes. The player class tracks the player's position, hunger, thirst, and health, which influence the gameâ€™s outcome.

## Materials Used
- **Laptop with Internet Connection**
- **AWS Account with Cloud9 instance configured**

## Skills Showcased
- Object-oriented programming with polymorphism and inheritance
- Virtual functions and pure abstract classes
- 2D array manipulation
- Game state management and player interactions
- Handling user input and boundary conditions

## How to Run
1. Implement the base and derived classes:
   - `Land` (abstract base class with virtual functions `getDescription()` and `visit(Player &p)`).
   - Derived classes such as `Forest`, `Desert`, `Lake` (each affecting the player differently).
   - `Player` class to track position and stats (hunger, thirst, health).
2. Randomly generate a 10x10 map with different terrain types.
3. Implement player movement with the following rules:
   - Players can move north, south, east, or west.
   - If a player moves beyond the boundary, implement a **wrap-around** (e.g., moving west from (0,5) places the player at (9,5)).
   - Each move decreases hunger and thirst; if either reaches zero, health decreases.
4. Extend the base gameplay by adding at least **three new land types** with unique random events (e.g., encountering wildlife, finding a town, meeting a traveler who provides items).
5. Ensure robust user input handling to prevent crashes or invalid inputs.
6. Compile and run the game using a C++ compiler:
   ```sh
   g++ -o survival_game main.cpp
   ./survival_game
   ```

## Additional Information
Ensure that the code properly handles boundary conditions, user input validation, and unique terrain interactions to enhance the gameplay experience.
